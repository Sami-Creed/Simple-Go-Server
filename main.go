	//After calling this method, you can access the parsed form data through r.Form, which is a map that holds the parsed values.

	// The statement if err := r.ParseForm(); err != nil checks if there was an error during the parsing process.

//Passing a pointer instead of a value is generally more efficient, especially for large structs. When you pass a struct by value, Go makes a copy of it. For a struct like http.Request, which can contain a lot of data, copying it could be costly in terms of memory and performance. Using a pointer avoids this overhead.
